  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
      detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
      maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
      and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
      sensed and other information.

      This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
      computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
      extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
      of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
      pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
      the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
      features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
      too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
      enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
      management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
      National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
      the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
    Purpose:
      SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
      soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
      product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
      associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
      available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
      Contact.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
    in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
    source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
    organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
    needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
    application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
    reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
    authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
    Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
    for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
    than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
    of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
    contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
    depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
    them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
    detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
    and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
    Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
    users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
      comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
      display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
      Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
      on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
      addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
      attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
      the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
    are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
    (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
    requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
    must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
    nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
    element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
    the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
    consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
    polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
    on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
    adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
    not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

    The Soil Survey of Bucks County, Pennsylvania is edge matched to
    the adjacent Pennsylvania Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) databases of
    Philadelphia County, Montgomery County, Lehigh County and Northampton
    County.  The Soil Survey of Bucks County, Pennsylvania is also edge
    matched to the adjacent New Jersey Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO)
    databases of Mercer County, Hunterdon County, Burlington County and
    Warren County.

    The feature edges (polygon and line segments) for this survey match
    adjacent ones in the edgematched soil surveys of Lehigh County,
    Pennsylvania, Northampton County, Pennsylvania, Montgomery County,
    Pennsylvania, Mercer County, New Jersey, Burlington County, New Jersey
    and Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  The feature labels and descriptive
    attributes (tabular information about the polygon and line segments) for
    the New Jersey counties match exactly to adjacent ones in Bucks County.
    Most feature labels and descriptive attributes for Lehigh County and
    Montgomery County match adjacent ones in Bucks County.

    The soil survey boundary for Bucks County matches the
    soil survey boundaries of the adjacent certified soil surveys.
  Completeness_Report:
    A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
    their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
    unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
    each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
    on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
    on the map is a delineation.

    Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
    that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
    named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
    may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
    on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
    not be indicated on the map.

    A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
    (map unit components), each with a designated range in
    proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
    or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
    or no recognizable soil.

    Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
    were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
    units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
    outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
    USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
    USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
    (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
    Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

    The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
    delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
    the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
    Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
    peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
    control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
    soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
    of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
    associations, and undifferentiated groups.

    Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
    In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
    dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
    minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
    identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
    taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
    area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
    significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
    dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
    does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
    nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
    generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

    Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
    of two or more dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
    repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
    is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
    complex or association is used in the name. The major components
    of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
    either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
    in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
    consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
    each major component is normally present though their proportions
    may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
    amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
    the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
    25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
    inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

    Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
    or more components that are not consistently associated
    geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
    the same map delineation. These components are included in the
    same named map unit because their use and management are the same
    or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
    because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
    flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
    additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
    included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
    major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
    regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
    consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
    principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
    undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

    Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
    descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
    one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
    transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
    3,000 acres.

    A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
    purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
    kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
    and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
    map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
    about 5 acres.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
        compilation to base maps that meet National Map
        Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
        feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
        soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
        field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
        locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
        with the transition between map units.

        For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
        occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
        abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
        narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
        generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
        the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
        between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
        matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
        locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
        by more than 0.01 inch.

      Process_Description:
        The Soil Survey of Bucks and Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania
        was published in 1975 at the 1:15,840 scale. Because of the
        dramatic increase in urbanization within the county since 1975, a
        soil survey update was needed.  An evaluation of the soil survey
        was made in 1985.  The evaluation found that significant changes
        in classification, land use, outdated soil series, and standards
        and procedures for making soil surveys, had made the 1975 survey
        obsolete. A soil survey update was approved in 1985.  The Bucks
        County, Pennsylvania Soil Survey Update is part of an ongoing survey
        project that includes the following Pennsylvania Counties: Berks,
        Chester, Delaware, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northhampton and Philadelphia.
        This survey update area will have the same soil mapping units across
        these eight counties.  There will be a perfect join for all eight
        counties with each other.  Bucks County joins Lehigh County and
        Northhampton County in the North, and Montgomery County and
        Philadelphia County in the South.  The Delaware River separates Bucks
        County from the following New Jersey Counties: Hunterdon, Mercer and
        Burlington.

        Field work for the second order soil survey began in 1988 with the
        Initial Field Review shortly thereafter.  Field data were collected
        by transecting map units to determine map unit composition, pedon
        sampling to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of
        soil, and locating the 1975 soil series type locations and
        reclassifying them with new taxonomic standards.  This field work
        provided soil scientists with information on patterns of soil
        occurrences that could be remotely sensed using 1:24,000 scale aerial
        photography, 1:24,000 scale ratioed film positives of the 1975
        published soil survey, and 7.5 minute topographic quadrangles showing
        landform contours. These patterns were checked in the field using
        standard data collection practices for soil surveying. Soil scientists
        analyzed soil samples in the laboratory and ran statistical methods
        to classify and develop series and mapping units. The classification
        and map unit names were finalized at the final correlation in February
        1997.

        Field soil scientists used 1:24,000 scale aerial photographs,
        topographic quadrangles and ratioed film positives of the published
        soil survey atlas sheets to compile the soil boundaries to the 7.5
        minute orthophotographic quadrangle base maps.  Aerial photographs at
        the 1:24000 scale, 7.5 minute topographic quadrangles and ratioed film
        positives of the 1975 published soil survey were used as reference for
        soil line and special soil feature placement, and correlation of map
        units.

      Process_Description:
        The annotated soil overlays, were scanned by Midwest Graphics Services
        Incorporated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on a drum scanner at a
        resolution of 200 dpi. The raster files, of the scanned soil lines,
        were imported into LTPlus for raster editing, map neatline development,
        labeling, edgematching, and vector conversion.  The cleaned vector
        files were transferred into ARC/INFO version 7.0.4 for final plotting,
        error analysis and quality control. The ARC/INFO "MAPJOIN" command
        was used to merge the 7.5 minute quadrangle ARC/INFO coverages into
        a seamless county coverage.  The polygon attributes and map unit
        acreages from the spatial data were checked against the February 1997
        final correlation legend.  Major and minor code pairs were assigned
        to map units and checked against the correlation legend and their
        order in the tabular data.  The seamless county coverage was cut into
        mathematically correct 7.5 minute quadrangles using the ARC/INFO
        "SPLIT" command. The soils data were plotted and checked against the
        annotated soil overlays for adherence to 0.01 inch line accuracy. The
        data were then exported as Digital Line Graph (DLG) 3 optional format
        files from ARC/INFO using the "ARCDLG" command and imported into Grass
        Version 4.13.  Special soil features were manually digitized, from
        the annotated soil overlays, using GRASS version 4.13 and checked
        against the digital soils data.  There were no special soil features
        digitized in the following quadrangles: Allentown East, Ambler,
        Bristol, Langhorne, Pennington and Stockton.  The data were written
        as DLG-3 optional format files using the v.dlg.out command.
        Compilation, digitizing, and quality control were performed by the
        soil scientists and cartographic technicians at the Pennsylvania
        Natural Resources Conservation Service Map Compilation and Digitizing
        Center. The digital maps of soil lines and special soil features were
        also reviewed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS),
        National Cartography and Geospatial Center (NCGC) staff in Fort Worth,
        Texas for adherence to SSURGO standards.  The NCGC, SSURGO Support
        Section staff imported the data for verification in ARC/INFO 7.1.1.
        The data were edited. New DLGs reflecting these changes were written
        with ARC/INFO 7.1.1.  The Map Unit Interpretations Record (MUIR)
        data base was developed by NRCS soil scientists according to national
        standards. Pennsylvania NRCS soil scientists supplied the SSURGO
        download from the MUIR database.  The data were certified and archived
        by NCGC.

        processed in ARCGIS 10.1 using a topology object with a 0.1 meter cluster
        tolerance for the purpose of eliminating gaps and overlaps within the region 3
        soils geodatabase.  Individual soil survey area data were exported as shapefiles
        from the regional geodatabase.  A datum transformation from NAD83 to WGS84 using
        the NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum transformation method was applied to the data.
        The data were checked with the SSURGO Evaluation scripts provided by U.S.
        Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. The shapefiles
        were uploaded to the soil data warehouse for archival and distribution.

        The Region 3 geodatabase for Bucks County, Pennsylvania was edited as
        part of the following projects. For the MLRA 148 Mapunit Alluvial Lands
        field work update, fluvaquents and udifluvents and udepts Project,
        polygon edits were made. Mapunit Fl was changed to HbA.
        The data were checked with the SSURGO Evaluation scripts provided by
        U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service.
        The shapefiles were then exported and uploaded to the soil data warehouse
        for archival and distribution through Web Soil Survey (WSS).

      Process_Description:
        The spatial data for the entire SSURGO database was recertified in October
        of 2019 to reduce storage requirements and to improve map display
        and geoprocessing performance.  The SSURGO data is internally managed
        using 3 Regional Transactional Spatial Databases (RTSD) that are in
        an ESRI File Geodatabase format.  The spatial extent of the RTSDs follow the
        Soil and Plant Science Division (SPSD) regional administrative boundaries.
        The XY coordinate system of this RTSD is USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area
        Conic USGS Version WKID: 102039 and has an XY storage precision of 0.001
        meters.  The RTSDs were recreated using a reduced storage precision of 0.1
        meters to reduce the physical size of the data.  The SSURGO data was also
        generalized by removing excess vertices, using a tolerance of 1 meter.
        The topology was validated at the CONUS level using a tolerance of 0.2
        meters.  This effort directly affects the gSSURGO and gNATSGO product since
        these deliverables are in a File Geodatabase format.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
      by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
      similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
      of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

      The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
      delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
      map unit key is used to link to information in the National
      Soil Information System tables.

      Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
      Information System database. This attribute database gives the
      proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
      each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
      on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
      interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
      agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

      The National Soil Information System database contains static
      metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
      information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
      are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
      database objects. Attributes include table and column
      descriptions and detailed domain information.

      The National Soil Information System database also contains a
      distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
      map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
      data.

      Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
      area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
      each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
